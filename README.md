# lightweight-build template

This template uses the snowpack build system (https://www.snowpack.dev/).

1. Ensure NodeJS is installed.  Go here to install: https://nodejs.org/en/ (recommended: the LTS version).
2. In a terminal, `npm install`.
3. In a terminal, `npm start`. This starts a local server that serves up the contents of the `public` folder, and the js
in the `src` folder.
4. Your web browser should automatically open, but if it doesn't, your terminal window should contain
helpful information.
5. If you see three circles, it's working.
6. Modify the css, html, and/or js files as you see fit. The web browser should automatically reload the page as you
make changes.
