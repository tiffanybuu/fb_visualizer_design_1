# Facebook Messenger Visualizer 

This template uses the snowpack build system (https://www.snowpack.dev/).

1. Ensure NodeJS is installed.  Go here to install: https://nodejs.org/en/ (recommended: the LTS version).
2. In a terminal, `npm install`.
3. In a terminal, `npm start`. This starts a local server that serves up the contents of the `public` folder, and the js
in the `src` folder.
4. Your web browser should automatically open, but if it doesn't, your terminal window should contain
helpful information.
5. If you see three circles, it's working.
6. Modify the css, html, and/or js files as you see fit. The web browser should automatically reload the page as you
make changes.


## Steps to run the repo:
#### 1. Download FB Messages
Download messages from Facebook by (Facebook Settings > Your Facebook Information > Download Your Information)
Once you have the downloaded folder, move the 'inbox' folder within the same repo directory as the data.py file. 

#### 2. In the console, run the following commands:
`pip install nltk`

`python data.py `
- A NLTK window will appear. Click download to get the required data files. Once everything is installed (it should all be colored green), you can close the download window and the script will process your Facebook data.

#### 3. run `npm start` to view the visualizer in the browser.
